# Awesome Early Exiting Papers
A curated list of Early Exiting papers, benchmarks, and misc. Currently, the resources listed in this repo are mainly in the field of natural language processing. Adding papers of early exiting in other fields (e.g. computer vision) is also welcome. 
> Early Exiting is an efficient technique that trains a deep model with multiple injected internal classifiers (exits) such that test samples can selectively exit instead of passing through the entire model.
